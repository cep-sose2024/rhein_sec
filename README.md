<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üîç About The Project

### What is Enmeshed?
<a href="https://github.com/nmshd">Enmeshed</a> is a open source Project by j&s-soft, the project offeres a secure and feutreistic concept to extchange information or documents between People or organisations, the application uses end to end encryption for secure transfer and privacy, more information can be found [here](https://enmeshed.eu/explore/how_does_enmeshed_work)

### How does it work?
This application is designed to provide a secure method for storing keys, which are currently stored insecurely to a network-based solution. This solution will be built on Hashicorp Vault and a C# ASP .NET core outward-facing API. The API will initialize user tokens and communicate with the Vault server.<br>
The backend of the application should be capable of running securely with any similar application that wishes to store keys securely and retrieve them using a user token.

The client side of the application is expected to communicate with the so-called ‚ÄòCrypto Abstraction Layer‚Äô, which is yet to be released by j&s-soft.


### Why Network Key storage? 
Network key storage is designed to solve the issue of some devices not having a Hardware Security Module that is compatible with the Enmeshed application. This would still allow older, non-bleeding-edge devices to store their keys securely.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Built With

* ASP .NET core 8.0.
* Hashicorp Vault 1.16.0.
* Rust for the Client side of the application.

## üèÉ Getting Started

Since the project is still early in development, there are no releases yet. Therefore, you must run the code in an IDE.<br>
We recommend the following:
* JetBrains RustRover for the client-side code
* JetBrains Rider for the server-side code

Additionally, you must have a HashiCorp Vault instance running on port 8200. The root token must be put in a file called `tokens.env` in the **backend/** directory. finally, make sure that the vault is also unsealed!

More instructions will follow as the project progresses.
