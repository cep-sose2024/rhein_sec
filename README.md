<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üîç About The Project

### What is Enmeshed?
<a href="https://github.com/nmshd">Enmeshed</a> is a open source Project by j&s-soft, the project offeres a secure and feutreistic concept to extchange information or documents between People or organisations, the application uses end to end encryption for secure transfer and privacy, more information can be found [here](https://enmeshed.eu/explore/how_does_enmeshed_work)

### How does our Network Key storage Solution work?
This application is designed to provide a secure method for storing keys, which are currently stored insecurely to a network-based solution. This solution will be built on Hashicorp Vault and a C# ASP .NET core outward-facing API. The API will initialize user tokens and communicate with the Vault server.<br>
The backend of the application should be capable of running securely with any similar application that wishes to store keys securely and retrieve them using a user token.

The client side of the application is expected to communicate with the so-called ‚ÄòCrypto Abstraction Layer‚Äô, which is yet to be released by j&s-soft.


### Why Network Key storage? 
Network key storage is designed to solve the issue of some devices not having a Hardware Security Module that is compatible with the Enmeshed application. This would still allow older, non-bleeding-edge devices to store their keys securely.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Built With

* ASP .NET core 8.0.
* Hashicorp Vault 1.16.1.
* Rust for the Client side of the application.

## üèÉ Getting Started

Since the project is still early in development, there are no releases yet. Therefore, you must run the code in an IDE.<br>
We recommend the following:
* JetBrains RustRover for the client-side code
* JetBrains Rider for the server-side code


### Setting up Vault
For testing purposes, we recommend using a locally hosted instance of Vault. Vault is available as a package on most Linux package managers.<br>
To install Vault on Arch using Pacman, use the following command:
``` bash 
sudo pacman -S vault 
```
Next, create a folder called `vault`, and download or copy the `VaultConfig` file from the misc folder.

Then, create certificates for your server using OpenSSL with the following commands:
```bash 
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```
In the `VaultConfig` file, change the path to the certificates with the one for the key and cert that you just created.

Finally, execute the following commands to start the Vault server:
``` bash 
mkdir -p vault/data/ && touch vault/data/vault.db
vault server -config=VaultConfig
```
After that, go to https://localhost:8200/ui/ and set up the root token and unseal the vault.

Finally, put the root token in a file called `tokens.env` in the **backend/** folder. The file should look like this: 
``` json
{
    "VaultToken": "hvs.your_token_here"
}
```

#### Known Issues:
- The C# code could produce errors if the certificate isn't trusted by your local CA.

More instructions will follow as the project progresses.
